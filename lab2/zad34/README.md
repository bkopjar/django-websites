This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

In the previous exercise we created a dictionary of famous scientistsâ€™ birthdays. In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load the birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, rather than having the dictionary defined in the program.
